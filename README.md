Functions
============


Most jobs in my workflow can be completed with `read_document` and
`read_dir`. The former generically reads in a .docx, .doc, .pdf, .html,
or .txt file without specifying the extension. The latter reads in
multiple .docx, .doc, .rtf, .pdf, .html, or .txt files from a directory
as a `data.frame` with a file and text column. This workflow is
effective because most text documents I encounter are stored as a .docx,
.doc, .rtf, .pdf, .html, or .txt file. The remaining common storage
formats I encounter include .csv, .xlsx, XML, structured .html, and SQL.
For these first 4 forms the
[**readr**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=readr),
[**readx**l](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=readxl),
[**xml2**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=xml2), and
[**rvest**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rvest). For SQL:

<tr class="odd">
<td>ROracle</td>

<tr class="even">
<td>RJDBC</td>
<td>JDBC</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

These packages are already specialized to handle these very specific
data formats. **textreadr** provides the basic reading tools that work
with the five basic file formats in which text data is stored.

Demonstration
=============

Load the Packages/Data
----------------------

    if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
    pacman::p_load(textreadr, magrittr)
    pacman::p_load_gh("trinker/pathr")

    trans_docs <- dir(
        system.file("docs", package = "textreadr"), 
        pattern = "^trans",
        full.names = TRUE
    )

    docx_doc <- system.file("docs/Yasmine_Interview_Transcript.docx", package = "textreadr")
    doc_doc <- system.file("docs/Yasmine_Interview_Transcript.doc", package = "textreadr")
    pdf_doc <- system.file("docs/rl10075oralhistoryst002.pdf", package = "textreadr")
    html_doc <- system.file('docs/textreadr_creed.html', package = "textreadr")
    txt_doc <- system.file('docs/textreadr_creed.txt', package = "textreadr")

    rtf_doc <- download(
        'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trinker/textreadr/master/inst/docs/trans7.rtf'
    )

    pdf_doc_img <- system.file("docs/McCune2002Choi2010.pdf", package = "textreadr")

Download
--------

`download` is simply a wrapper for `curl::curl_download` that allows
multiple documents to be download, has the `tempdir` pre-set as the
`destfile` (named `loc` in **textreadr**), and also returns the path to
the file download for easy use in a **magrittr** chain.

Here I download a .docx file of presidential debated from 2012.

    'https://github.com/trinker/textreadr/raw/master/inst/docs/pres.deb1.docx' %>%
        download() %>%
        read_docx() %>%
        head(3)

    ## pres.deb1.docx read into C:\Users\Tyler\AppData\Local\Temp\RtmpmKFBUe

    ## [1] "LEHRER: We'll talk about -- specifically about health care in a moment. But what -- do you support the voucher system, Governor?"                           
    ## [2] "ROMNEY: What I support is no change for current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare. And the president supports taking $716 billion out of that program."
    ## [3] "LEHRER: And what about the vouchers?"

Generic Document Reading
------------------------

The `read_document` is a generic wrapper for `read_docx`, `read_doc`,
`read_html`, and `read_pdf` that detects the file extension and chooses
the correct reader. For most tasks that require reading a .docx, .doc,
.html, .pdf, or .txt file this is the go-to function to get the job
done. Below I demonstrate reading each of these five file formats with
`read_document`.

    docx_doc %>%
        read_document() %>%
        head(3)

    txt_doc %>%
        read_document() %>%
        paste(collapse = "\n") %>%
        cat()

    ## | RJDBC       | JDBC                   |

Read Directory Contents
-----------------------

Often there is a need to read multiple files in from a single directory.
The `read_dir` function wraps other **textreadr** functions and `lapply`
to create a data frame with a document and text column (one row per
document). We will read the following documents from the 'pos' directory
in **textreadr**'s system file:

    levelName
    pos          
      Â¦--0_9.txt  
      Â¦--1_7.txt  
      Â¦--10_9.txt 
      Â¦--11_9.txt 
      Â¦--12_9.txt 
      Â¦--13_7.txt 
      Â¦--14_10.txt
      Â¦--15_7.txt 
      Â¦--16_7.txt 
      Â¦--17_9.txt 
      Â¦--18_7.txt 
      Â¦--19_10.txt
      Â¦--2_9.txt  
      Â¦--3_10.txt 
      Â¦--4_8.txt  
      Â¦--5_10.txt 
      Â¦--6_10.txt 
      Â¦--7_7.txt  
      Â¦--8_7.txt  
      Â°--9_7.txt

Here we have read the files in, one row per file.

    system.file("docs/Maas2011/pos", package = "textreadr") %>%
        read_dir() %>%
        peek(Inf, 40)

Read .docx
----------

A .docx file is nothing but a fancy container. It can be parsed via XML.
The `read_docx` function allows the user to read in a .docx file as
plain text. Elements are essentially the p tags (explicitly `//w:p`) in
the markup.

    docx_doc %>%
        read_docx() %>%
        head(3)

    ## [1] "JRMC2202 Audio Project"      "Interview Transcript"       
    ## [3] "Interviewer: Yasmine Hassan"

    docx_doc %>%
        read_docx(15) %>%
        head(3)

    ## [1] "Hassan:           Could you please tell me your name, your title, your age, and your place of ref,                                   umm, residence?"
    ## [2] "Abd Rabou:   My name is Ahmad Abd Rabou. I’m assistant professor of comparative politics at"

Read .doc
---------

A .doc file is a bit trickier to read in than .docx but is made easy by
the **antiword** package which wraps the
[Antiword](http://www.winfield.demon.nl) program in an OS independent
way.

    doc_doc %>%
        read_doc() %>%

Read .rtf
---------

Rich text format (.rtf) is a plain text document with markup similar to
latex. The **striprtf** package provides the backend for `read_rtf`.

Read .pdf
---------

Like .docx a .pdf file is simply a container. Reading PDF's is made
easier with a number of command line tools. A few methods of PDF reading
have been incorporated into R. Here I wrap **pdftools** `pdf_text` to
produce `read_pdf`, a function with sensible defaults that is designed
to read PDFs into R for as many folks as possible right out of the box.

Here I read in a PDF with `read_pdf`. Notice the result is a data frame
with meta data, including page numbers and element (row) ids.

        read_pdf()

### Image Based pdf: OCR

Image based .pdfs require optical character recognition (OCR) in order
for the images to be converted to text. The `ocr` argument of `read_pdf`
allows the user to read in image based .pdf files and allow the
[**tesseract**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tesseract) package do
the heavy lifting in the backend. You can look at the .pdf we'll be
using by running:

    textreadr:::open_path(pdf_doc_img)

First let's try the task without using OCR.

    pdf_doc_img %>%
        read_pdf(ocr = FALSE)

    ## Table: [0 x 3]
    ## 
    ## [1] page_id    element_id text      
    ## <0 rows> (or 0-length row.names)
    ## ... ...        ...        ...

And now using OCR via **tesseract**. Note that `ocr = TRUE` is the
default behavior of `read_pdf`.

    pdf_doc_img %>%
        read_pdf(ocr = TRUE)

    ## Converting page 1 to C:\Users\AppData\Local\Temp\RtmpKeJAnL/McCune2002Choi2010_01.png... done!

Read .html
----------

Often a researcher only wishes to grab the text from the body of .html
files. The `read_html` function does exactly this task. For finer
control over .html scraping the user may investigate the **xml2** &
**rvest** packages for parsing .html and .xml files. Here I read in HTML
with `read_html`.

    html_doc %>%
        read_html()

Read Transcripts
----------------

Many researchers store their dialogue data (including interviews and
observations) as a .docx or .xlsx file. Typically the data is a two
column format with the person in the first column and the text in the
second separated by some sort of separator (often a colon). The
`read_transcript` wraps up many of these assumptions into a reader that
will extract the data as a data frame with a person and text column. The
`skip` argument is very important for correct parsing.

Here I read in and parse the different formats `read_transcript`
handles. These are the files that will be read in:

    basename(trans_docs)

    ## [1] "trans1.docx" "trans2.docx" "trans3.docx" "trans4.xlsx" "trans5.xls"

### docx With Skip

`skip` is important to capture the document structure. Here not skipping
front end document matter throws an error, while `skip = 1` correctly
parses the file.

    read_transcript(trans_docs[2])

    ## Error in data.frame(X1 = trimws(speaker), X2 = trimws(pvalues), stringsAsFactors = FALSE): arguments imply differing number of rows: 7, 8

### docx With Dash Separator

The colon is the default separator. At times other separators may be
used to separate speaker and text. Here is an example where hypens are
used as a separator. Notice the poor parse with colon set as the default
separator the first go round.

### Reading Text

Like `read.table`, `read_transcript` also has a `text` argument which is
useful for demoing code.

    read_transcript(
        text=

    "34    The New York Times reports a lot of words here.
    12    Greenwire reports a lot of words.
    31    Only three words.
     2    The Financial Times reports a lot of words.
     9    Greenwire short.
    13    The New York Times reports a lot of words again.",

        col.names = c("NO", "ARTICLE"), sep = "   "
    )

    ## Table: [6 x 2]

### Authentic Interview

Here I read in an authentic interview transcript:

    docx_doc %>%
        read_transcript(c("Person", "Dialogue"), skip = 19)

    ## Table: [13 x 2]
    ##

Pairing textreadr
-----------------

**textreadr** is but one package used in the text analysis (often the
first package used). It pairs nicely with a variety of other text
munging and analysis packages. In the example below I show just a few
other package pairings that are used to extract case names (e.g., "Jones
v. State of New York") from a [Supreme Court Database Code
Book](http://scdb.wustl.edu/_brickFiles/2012_01/SCDB_2012_01_codebook.pdf).
I demonstrate pairings with
[**textshape**](https://github.com/trinker/textshape),
[**textclean**](https://github.com/trinker/textclean),
[**qdapRegex**](https://github.com/trinker/qdapRegex), and
[**dplyr**](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr).

    if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman"); library(pacman)
    p_load(dplyr, qdapRegex)
    p_load_current_gh(file.path('trinker', c('textreadr', 'textshape', 'textclean')))

    ## Read in pdf, split on variables
    dat <- 'http://scdb.wustl.edu/_brickFiles/2012_01/SCDB_2012_01_codebook.pdf' %>%
        textreadr::download() %>%
        textreadr::read_pdf() %>%
        filter(page_id > 5 & page_id < 79) %>%
        mutate(
            loc = grepl('Variable Name', text, ignore.case=TRUE),
            text = textclean::replace_non_ascii(text)
        ) %>%
        textshape::split_index(which(.$loc) -1) %>%
        lapply(select, -loc)

    ## Function to extract cases
    ex_vs <- qdapRegex::ex_(pattern = "((of|[A-Z][A-Za-z'.,-]+)\\s+)+([Vv]s?\\.\\s+)(([A-Z][A-Za-z'.,-]+\\s+)*((of|[A-Z][A-Za-z',.-]+),?($|\\s+|\\d))+)")

    ## Extract and filter cases
    dat %>%
        lapply(function(x) {
            x$text %>%
                textshape::combine() %>%
                ex_vs()  %>% 
                c() %>% 
                textclean::mgsub(c("^[ ,]+", "[ ,0-9]+$", "^(See\\s+|E\\.g\\.?,)"), "", fixed=FALSE)
        }) %>%
        setNames(seq_along(.)) %>%
        {.[sapply(., function(x) all(length(x) > 1 | !is.na(x)))]}
